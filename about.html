			<h1>Data driven everything</h1>
			<p>
				Misapplied Math aims to deliver unconventional and entertaining applications of computers and mathematics to trading, data science, and life. Pure mathematicians seek beautiful, elegant solutions to abstract problems. Noisy data, approximations, and heuristics underpin data science and statistics. At the intersection of pure and applied math, algorithms rule everything. From computer assisted proofs of the Kepler Conjecture to logistics, optimization, and cryptography, computers changed the way we seek quantitative solutions to problems. Opportunity drives innovation, and in finance, the delineation between trader, quant, and programmer fades. Increasingly sophisticated market participants remove old inefficiencies, and at times create new ones.

			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Kelly Littlepage, an algorithmic trader and entrepreneur whose work interests are in the fields of computationally intensive statistics, stochastic control, and data science. I'm the founder and managing partner at <a href="http://www.indigoshift.com/" target="_blank">indigoShift</a> where we're building a new paradigm and a more open platform for algorithmic trading. Linux and open source software makes this possible, and I code in many languages for work and for play. When I'm not coding I run, hike, and explore the cities that I've called home: Denver, Los Angeles, New York, Hong Kong, and Chicago.
